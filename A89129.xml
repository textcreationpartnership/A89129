            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat whereas many miseries doe attend upon a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill-war, there is none greater than the breaking of that conjunction which matrimony hath once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, so that womens husbands being absent at the wars, they cannot injoy that necessary comfort and benevolence which they expect from them: this, if well considered, is a shrewd matter, and doth give beginning to a naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population of Townes and Cities, when the causes of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous fertillity are any waies hindred, whereby all places, especially this famous City, must needs become very thin of people, and great want of men, fit for employment both for Church and State, and all Corporations must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily from thence ensue, for men grow not up on a suddain, there must be a seed time before harvest, bearing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before their birth, as we very well know, who in that kinde have been great assistants unto women, and constant deliverers of much good to the Common wealth.</p>
            <p>And whereas we are called Midwives by our Profession, we knowing the cases of women better than any other, as being more experienced in what they sensibly suffer since the wars began, living the religious lives of some cloysterd Nuns, contrary to their own naturall affections, if they could by any meanes help it, without wronging their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159902:3"/> Our owne Complaint shall therefore consist of many branches, whereby the injuries of women in this present age may be clearly discerned, for it is a great wrong that women should want their husbands and live without comfort, thereby we Midwives are also undone, for as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are helpers unto men, so are we unto women in all their extremities, for which we were formerly well paid, and highly respected in our parishes for our great skil and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night industry, but now our Art doth fail us, and little get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have we in this age barren of all naturall joyes, and onely fruitfull in bloudy calamities, we desire therefore that for the better propagation of our owne benefit, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good of all women, wives may no longer snare their husbands to be devoured by the sword, but may keep them fast locked within their owne loving armes day and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159902:3"/> of promised marriage, and wives by the hand of death were quickly Widdowed, and with them the hope of posterity was also extinguished, it is therefore hereafter to be desired that Warre may not eate up and devoure the youth of this Kingdom, but that men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the blessing given to <hi>Adam,</hi> by encreasing and multiplying, thereby to repayre the great havock and losse which this unnaturall Warre doth make in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Heretofore the happinesse of the English wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was compared unto Heaven, but now they have just cause to tremble at the report of every Gunne, which can send a speedy death to their instruments of conjunction and delight, without whom they are but halfe themselves, and being indeed nothing in themselves, from them they received perfection, weight measure and number, and grow as rich in children as they are in beauty, while we Midwives shall fare and feede the better for their frequent christnings and gossipings.</p>
            <p>We take notice what Devillish new Engines for Warre are daily invented by the Cyclops and such like Artists, to destroy one another; namely the Poleax, Petronels, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, Firelocks, Snap-hances, Pistols, nay cases of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols, Granadoes, and their hand Granadoes, and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peices, and your terrible two-edged swords, able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright poore women to see such naked weapons; then the Cavalliers, and your Dragoneers and your Ingineers, which are those persons which exercise those weapons: such instruments were never used, or scarce seene in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all out of jealousies, doubts and feares; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you men will not confide in one another: All these weapons are but to destroy brave men which should be preserved and kept for better uses and purposes: It were farre better for those men that they followed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159902:4"/> their own trade, and the old game of England at home with their wives; then for them to run abroad to be Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and common souldiers and stand Sentinel two or three houres in the cold for a little Suffolk cheese and a peice of browne bread, and at length kill one another for eight pence a day, with the night to boot too: and it may be lose a limbe or some other good joynt: when indeed and in very good sooth they need not stand at home so long by nineteen parts and have more thanks (if not a reward) for their paines.</p>
            <p>It were nothing so irkesome to us poor Midwives that our trade is now decayed, if the sword in the scabbard were used and employed against a Forreigne Enemy; it would not then be halfe so grievous, for the old proverbe saith, what the eye sees not, the heart grieves not at. But we poor Midwives both see, and our hearts know it and now our tongues confesse it; that it is a lamentable case when the son shall goe out against the father; father against the son; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against brother, and kinsman against kinsman, this we speake is grievous to be thought on; and we condole even to the lower-most angle of our triangular hearts.</p>
            <p>We desire therefore that a period may be set to these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy differences, and that the generall and naturall Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard may no longer lye couchant; but that women may be fruitfull vines, that there may be no armes, but such as will lovingly embrace women, and because we know that some upon different occasions desire to absent themselves from their best beloved, having first plundered their chests and tooke away that they have, we desire that such men may be compelled forthwith to return to their wives, or beare on their heads the fortune which they have most worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, being guilty of that punishment by their long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>And whereas all are not Penelopes that can withstand the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159902:4"/> siege of a strong temptation, but must yeeld up the Fort to the flattering enemie of their long preserved chastity, it is better to keepe then to make that fraile sex honest: let not therefore the drumme wound the ayre no more with false stroakes, nor the pike be bathed in the bloud of guiltlesse men, let not the sword ravish from our bosomes the delight of our lives: this word Husband speaking benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort both to Wives and Midwives, since our felicity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without the others fertillity and fruitfulnesse, and therefore let us Midwives whom it most nearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes, desire that some order may be taken; that the old Song of <hi>England,</hi> may not bee againe revived, <hi>slow men of London:</hi> And that the delicate sex of women may not lye in their beds like cold Marble images cut out by some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers hand, but being full of warme spirit and life, they may obliege the world to them by repairing the losses of this war, and have husbands as formerly, at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to maintain them bravely, and bring them yearly under the delivering power of the Midwife, which cannot be done unlesse the wars cease, and men return again unto their wives.</p>
            <p>Moreover wee have just cause to feare those dreadfull Prophesies which point so directly at this age, foretelling <note place="margin">Mother Shiptons Prophesie.</note> that there should be a great scarcity of men, and such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of women farre exceeding the other, both in strength and number, so that a hundred should run after one, being a fearfull prodigy in nature, and a dearth to be more feared, than that of Corn, or any other commodity: Coales are not so necessary as Husbands warme in bed, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table at board, and therefore in this sad age it is fit to take a view of the calamities of women in other Nations, for if men be scarce, all other plenty is nothing to women, they consummate our happinesse, and make us richer than all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159902:5"/> the precious stones of the Indyes, therefore most deplorable will the continuall losse of more Souldiers be, since they might live to comfort us, &amp; declare their undaunted valour in the soft and delightfull field of love: And whereas most certaine intelligence hath bin brought unto us, that the Queene when she was in England did heretofore set up her Standard: we desire likewise that our Standard may once again be set up in our City and Suburbs; for we Midwives know that women are not so cold or out of soule, but that they can endure a fight bravely under a Standard, and can use a weapon as well as men if they get it in their handling, let their courage therfore teach them to fight for their own priviledges, and if they prove the weaker vessels, yet wee Midwives desire that the distresses of widowed women be looked upon with a charitable construction, not doubting but by all good willers to their sex, this complaint will be regarded as the publique voyce of their long conceal'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, shewing also how greatly necessitated they have bin in their husbands absence, whose happy returne shall satisfie their longing, and give us the Midwives of London great cause to rejoyce. For although we were in good hopes that the wars were now brought to a happy end &amp; therfore did intend to wave this petition or Complaint in the happy enjoying of our Husbands, yet our feare is that the Wars in Ireland beginning now again, and there being some clouds which threaten from the North, that we in these winter nights may still want the company of our husbands and have as cold &amp; empty bodyes and (if timely Redresse be not had) as just an occasion of complaint, as ever heretofore.</p>
